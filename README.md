# Anomaly Detection in Smart Meters

## Project Overview
This project is focused on developing an anomaly detection system for gas consumption data collected from smart meters. The objective is to identify unusual consumption patterns that may indicate potential leaks or unauthorized use, leveraging machine learning techniques for accurate detection.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleansing and preparing time-series data from smart meters.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Using Isolation Forest algorithms to detect anomalies in gas consumption.
- **Visualization**: Implementing a Dash application for interactive data visualization to observe real-time and historical data.
